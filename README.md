# Hack the Interview ⌨️
This is a repository where I will work in order to prepare myself for a coding interview.
# Contents 📜
This repository contains solved problems in many programming languages such Java, Python or Javascript. It also has all the resources that I consider useful for preparing a coding interview.

Here are the contents in a list:

- Problems - Coding problems solved.
- Data Structures - My own implementation of data structures.
- Notes - About learning resources, about some hacks (if there are any), and more.

# Notes 📝
The notes will be useful to keep in one place useful learning resources like videos, entire courses or articles related to problem solving or other useful computer science topics.

I will also write my own useful stuff for problem solving, data structures or good practices.

# Progress tracking
I will write a JSON for keeping track of my progress, the last problem solved and how many problems I solved per day, week, or month.
The JSON is just for using it on my personal website. 🙂
