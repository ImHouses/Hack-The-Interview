# Array List
An **Array** is a contiguous area of memory of equal-size elements indexed by contigious integers.
An **Array List** is like a dynamic array, i.e., an array than can be resized automatically in case there is not
enough space for a new element.

## Array Operations

- **Access one element** O(1) time / O(1) space.
- **Insert one element**: O(1) time. O(n) if a resize operation is needed / Same for space.
- **Find item** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
- **Get element at a given index** O(1) time. / O(1) space.
- **Insert element at a given index** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
- **Delete element** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
- **Remove all element occurences** O(n) time. / O(n) space.
