# What is a Linked List?
An **Linked List** is a set of nodes where each node has a reference to the next node.
Every Linked List has a first node called __head__ and a last node called __tail__.
Every Node serves as a container for our elements.

## Array Operations

- **Access one element with index** O(n) time / O(1) space.
- **Insert one element (at the start or end)**: O(1) time. / O(1) space.
- **Find item** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
- **Get element at a given index** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
- **Insert element at a given index** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
- **Delete element** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
- **Remove all element occurences** O(n) time. / O(1) space.
